- When replying to an old thread (everyone almost forgets about it), send it to the channel also.
- When replying to a thread, If the reply is important to the whole channel, send it to the channel also.

### Emoji Using Guide

DO NOT communicate using emojis. Emojis are not a language. They are a way to express emotions. Use emojis to express emotions, not to communicate. If you want to acknowledge something, type your texts. If you want to express yourself read the message, type "noted".

Why abolishment of emojis from the last convention?
1. Emojis cause the person at the other end confused to understand. There's no way to know who react to the message, and when. She/he has to hover over the emoji to see who react to the message. It's not a good way to communicate. Too much a burden for communication.
2. It's not respectful.

## Email

- Use email for formal communication, especially for communication with Customers or Partners.
- Use email to confirm important decisions.
- Should not use email for urgent communication.
- Should not use email for discussion.
- Use formal language in the email.
- If there are attachments, mention them in the email body.
- The Subject should be clear and concise.
- Recommended subject format: `[Project Name] Subject`
- Favor Reply All over Reply in a Loop mail.
Always include a `greeting`, `sign-off`, and `signature` in the email, even if it is a Reply.
