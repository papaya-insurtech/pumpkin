# SSDLC - Secure Software Development Lifecycle

## Plan Phase

Assess risks and security threat landscape
Evaluate the potential impact of security incidents like reputational risk to the business

## Requirements Phase

Include security requirements as part of defining functional requirements
Understand and incorporate compliance and regulatory requirements

## Design Phase

Engage in threat modeling
Make security considerations an integral part of the architecture plan
Evaluate security impact of design phase choices such as platform and UI

## Development Phase

Educate developers on secure coding practices (e.g OWASP Top Ten)
Incorporate security testing tools in development process (e.g linters, static analysis tool)
Implement code review processes
Evaluate software dependencies and mitigate potential security risks

## Document Phase

Document security controls and processes
Assemble the information to prepare for audits, compliance checks, and security reviews

## Testing Phase

Perform security testing such as static analysis and interactive application security testing.

## Deployment Phase

Security assessment of deployment environment
Review configurations for security

## Maintain Phase

Implement monitoring to detect threats
Be prepared to respond to vulnerabilities and intrusions with remediations
