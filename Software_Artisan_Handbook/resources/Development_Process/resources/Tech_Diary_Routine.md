# Tech Diary Routine

## Purpose

A place for everyone to write a daily diary about what they have accomplished (completed tasks, ongoing tasks, new things learned, the value created, what they will do tomorrow).

## How it works

- There is a slack channel #tech-diary for everyone to write their daily updates.
- Each member will create their thread (for the first time onboarding) to write their daily diary, when replying to the thread, remember to tick "Also send to #tech-diary".
- You can view the latest updates of all members in order, and each member can still view their updates separately without being mixed up with the others.
- Members will write their updates at the end of the day, and read them again at the beginning of the next day.
- Members can quickly find their thread via Pinned messages on the channel.

## Sample format for an update

`Sunday, 2023-04-09`

Today I have completed the following tasks:

- Task `task name 1` (Jira issues link) (how much time it took)
- Task `task name 2` (Jira issues link) (how much time it took)
- I have sent xyz information to customer abc. (how much time it took)

Today I have learned the following (optional):

- How to resolve git merge conflicts better through this [article](link)
- How to create tables and relationships on Hasura through task `task name 1` (Jira issues link) and guidance from Mr. ...

Today I have created value that I am proud of (optional):

- I helped the company save $100/month by completing task `task name 1` (Jira issues link).
- I helped the Claim team save 30 minutes/day X 30 people with the feature in task `task name 2` (Jira issues link).

Tomorrow I need to do and complete the following:

- I started working on task `task name 3` (Jira issues link) halfway through, and will continue tomorrow.
- I need to push for Mr. Hai and Mr. Loc to review tasks `task name 4` (Jira issues link) tomorrow because the deadline is approaching.
- I need to review the technical requirements of partner XYZ tomorrow and send feedback before 11 am.

## Best practice

- Create a Draft Slack message reply to your thread, tick `send to #tech-diary`.
- Update your draft message whenever you have done a task, or learning a new thing, even if it is a tiny task.
- After the bot reminder message pops up, you review your draft update and submit it.
- In case you forget to tick `send to #tech-diary`, you can still send it by clicking on the `Send to channel` button on the action menu of the message.
