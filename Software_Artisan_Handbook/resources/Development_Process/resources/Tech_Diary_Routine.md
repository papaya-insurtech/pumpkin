# Tech Diary Routine

## Purpose

A place for everyone to write a daily diary about what they have accomplished (completed tasks, ongoing tasks, new things learned, the value created, what they will do tomorrow).

## How it works

- There is a slack channel #tech-diary for everyone to write their daily updates.
- Each member will have their thread to write their daily diary, when replying to their thread, remember to tick "Also send to #tech-diary".
- You can view the latest updates of all members in order, and each member can still view their updates separately without being mixed up with the others.
- Members will write their updates at the end of the day, and read them again at the beginning of the next day.
