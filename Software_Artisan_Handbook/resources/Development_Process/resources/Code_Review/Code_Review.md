# Code Review

Code review is the process of examining code written by another developer to ensure that it meets certain standards and is free of errors. Code review is an essential part of the software development process, as it helps to identify and fix bugs, improve code quality, and ensure that the code is maintainable and scalable.

## Benefits of Code Review

There are several benefits of code review, including:

- **Improved code quality:** Code review helps to identify and fix errors and bugs in the code, which improves the overall quality of the codebase.

- **Knowledge sharing:** Code review provides an opportunity for developers to learn from each other and share knowledge about best practices, coding standards, and new technologies.

- **Reduced development time:** By catching errors early in the development process, code review can help to reduce the time and effort required to fix bugs later on.

- **Improved collaboration:** Code review encourages collaboration between developers, which can lead to better teamwork and more effective communication.

## Code Review Process

The code review process typically involves the following steps:

1. **Preparation:** Before starting the code review, the reviewer should ensure that they have a clear understanding of the requirements and specifications for the code being reviewed. The PR will have a reference to the jira task that the developer is working on. The reviewer should read the jira task and make sure that they understand the requirements and specifications.

2. **Review:** To conduct a thorough code review, the reviewer must adhere to the guidelines outlined in the [Code Review Checklist](./Code_Review_Checklist.md), activate their restrict mode, and maintain a strict standard for code quality.

3. **Feedback:** The reviewer should provide feedback to the developer, highlighting any issues they have found and suggesting ways to improve the code. The feedback should be constructive and specific and should focus on improving the quality of the code.

4. **Revision:** The developer should revise the code based on the feedback provided by the reviewer.
    - They should address any issues that were identified and make any necessary changes to improve the quality of the code.
    - Create a new commit for each time you make a code change due to resolve the feedback.
    - Mark the feedback as resolved once you have made the changes.

5. **Approval:** Once the code has been revised, the reviewer should review it again to ensure that all issues have been addressed. If the code meets the required standards, it can be approved and merged into the codebase.

## Best Practices for Code Review

To ensure that code review is effective, it is important to follow certain best practices, including:

- **Be specific:** Feedback should be specific and focused on improving the quality of the code. Vague or general feedback is less helpful and can be confusing for the developer.

- **Be constructive:** Feedback should be constructive and aimed at helping the developer to improve their skills and knowledge. Criticism should be avoided, and feedback should be delivered respectfully and professionally.

- **Be timely:** Code review should be conducted promptly, ideally within a few days of the code being submitted. This helps to ensure that issues are caught early in the development process and can be addressed before they become more difficult to fix.

- **Be consistent:** Code review should be conducted consistently across the entire codebase, with the same standards and best practices applied to all code.
