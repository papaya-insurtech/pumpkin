## Use case

Build a web application to consume a GraphQL API.  
You can choose any public GraphQL API on the internet or if you can build your own API, it will be a big plus.

This is an example that you can choose:

- [GraphQL - https://graphqlzero.almansi.me/](https://graphqlzero.almansi.me/)

Or you can also use other APIs that you found.

The features should at least cover some basic features:

- Authentication: you can use the auth from your chosen API or can also use a social auth like Facebook, Google...
- Listing, Searching, Pagination (infinite loading)
- Create
- Update
- Delete

## Technical requirements

- Should be implemented using React/Next.js & Hooks
- Using TypeScript with Strict Mode
- Consuming a GraphQL API using Apollo Client
- Writing some unit tests

## Submission

- Push your project onto a GitHub repository
- Deploy your app onto Vercel
