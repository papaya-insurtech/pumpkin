# Experience Sharing

## Note

- Please provide an estimated timeline that you feel comfortable with.
- This open assignment is designed to help us learn more about your experience, mindset, and problem-solving skills, allowing us to better prepare for the upcoming interview.
- If you have any issues, don't hesitate to contact us.
- Be specific: if you experienced a slow query, what is the query? What is the exact data it's fetching? How many bytes and rows the tables store? How long in milliseconds did the slow query take? If you improved the query, what *exactly* did you do?

## Task

Please share a solution you developed in the past that significantly increased user value or solved a key user problem.  
In your response, please cover:

- The specific issue or challenge the users were facing. We care less about the technical prowess, the smallest problem can bring the biggest impact in value for the users if done right.
- The value or impact you aimed to deliver.
- Your approach to the problem and how you arrived at your solution.
- The detailed solution you implemented and the reasoning behind your choice.
- The results or improvements that followed after the solution was implemented.
- How you identify the problem with numbers and how you measure the results.

## Submission

- Feel free to use any format you prefer to share your insights.
- You can submit your files directly to us, via a link to a cloud storage service (Google Drive, OneDrive, etc.), or through a link to a public repository (GitHub, GitLab, etc.).
