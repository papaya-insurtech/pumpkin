# Back End Challenge 1

## Note

- If you have any issues or questions don't hesitate to contact us.

## Use case

Build a serverless service to resize images on-the-fly.

The service should follow these requirements:

- Public an API endpoint with the format: `https://somedomain/path/to/image.jpg?width=100&height=100`
- The service should resize the image to the given width and height
- Supporting caching for the resized images
- Supporting CDN
- Supporting at least these image types: jpg, png

## Technical requirements

- Using TypeScript
- Using Node.js
- Using AWS services to build the service
- [Optional] If you can use IaC (e.g [Serverless Framework](https://www.serverless.com/), [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)) to build the service, it will be a big plus

## Submission

- Push your project onto a GitHub repository
- Deploy your service with a testable link & image
