- [RESTful - https://any-api.com/](https://any-api.com/)

Or you can also use other APIs that you found.

The features should at least cover some basic features:

- Authentication: you can use the auth from your chosen API or can also use a social auth like Facebook, Google...
- Listing
- Create
- Update
- Delete

## Technical requirements
